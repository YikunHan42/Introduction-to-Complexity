## Roadmap From SFI

#### Are you new to ComplexityExplorer.org?

Enroll in [Introduction to Complexity](http://intro.complexityexplorer.org/) to learn the fundamentals of complexity science.

#### Do you want to understand the foundational theories of complex systems science?

Explore [Computation in Complex Systems](http://computation.complexityexplorer.org/), [Fractals and Scaling](http://fractals.complexityexplorer.org/), [Game Theory I](https://gts.complexityexplorer.org/) & [II](http://gtd.complexityexplorer.org/), [Introduction to Information Theory](http://information.complexityexplorer.org/), and [Nonlinear Dynamics](http://nonlinear.complexityexplorer.org/).

#### Do you want to use particular methods to study a complex system? 

Consider [Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling](http://abm.complexityexplorer.org/), [Maximum Entropy Methods](http://maxent.complexityexplorer.org/), [Random Walks](http://random.complexityexplorer.org/), [Vector and Matrix Algebra](http://matrix.complexityexplorer.org/), and [Fundamentals of Machine Learning](http://ml.complexityexplorer.org/), among other great offerings.

#### Are you curious about how complexity applies to a specific system? 

Register for [Origins of Life](http://origins.complexityexplorer.org/) for a complex systems perspective on the emergence of life or the [Foundations and Applications of Humanities Analytics](http://faha.complexityexplorer.org/) course to learn about computational approaches to the humanities.
